## Slide 2 - Problem Statement

### The Problem We're Solving

Fake IDs have gotten dangerously good, creating huge risks for businesses that still rely on manual checks. While powerful verification tools exist, they're built for large corporations with deep pockets, leaving smaller organizations unprotected and vulnerable to fraud.

### How We Know This is a Real Problem: Sources with Graphs & Data

The evidence of this problem is overwhelming and well-documented across multiple reports and articles that contain valuable data visualizations:

*   **Financial Losses Are Soaring**: Identity fraud has reached staggering levels. According to a 2023 report from the **National Council on Identity Theft Protection**, total losses from identity fraud were projected to hit **$43 billion** in the U.S. alone, affecting millions of citizens.

### Why This Problem Matters: Local, National, and Global Impact

The consequences of identity fraud are felt at every level of society:

*   **Local Impact**: For a local business like a bar or retail store, accepting a fake ID can lead to severe penalties, including hefty fines and the loss of their operating license. Beyond legal trouble, it damages their reputation and exposes them to financial loss from fraudulent purchases or chargebacks.

*   **National Impact**: On a national scale, fake identities are a key enabler of serious crimes. They are used to commit tax fraud, illegally obtain government benefits, and can even pose a direct threat to national security by allowing unauthorized access to secure facilities or critical infrastructure.

*   **Global Impact**: Globally, the ability to create and use fake identities is the backbone of transnational organized crime. It facilitates multi-billion dollar illicit industries like money laundering, human trafficking, and terrorist financing, making it a critical threat to international stability and safety.

Given these severe and wide-ranging risks, a universally accessible, reliable, and easy-to-use tool for spotting fraudulent documents is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. That's the mission of AI-NaMo.

## Slide 3 - Existing Solutions

While several identity verification solutions exist, they often fall short for small to medium-sized businesses and organizations due to high costs and complexity.

**Current Solutions:**

Major players like **Onfido**, **Jumio**, and **Veriff** offer powerful, enterprise-grade identity verification platforms. They are trusted by large companies in finance, tech, and government sectors to combat fraud and comply with regulations.

**Key Features of Existing Solutions:**

*   **AI-Powered Analysis**: They use sophisticated AI to analyze government-issued IDs, cross-reference data points, check for security features, and match the ID photo to a live selfie.
*   **Liveness Detection**: These platforms can determine if a person is physically present during the verification process using advanced biometrics to prevent spoofing with photos or videos.
*   **Global Coverage**: They support thousands of document types from over 200 countries and territories.

**The Gap in the Market: Limitations of These Solutions:**

*   **Prohibitive Cost**: These services are extremely expensive, with pricing models based on per-verification fees or large annual contracts, making them inaccessible for small businesses, non-profits, or individual developers.
*   **Complex Integration**: Implementing these solutions can be a complicated and time-consuming process, often requiring a dedicated engineering team.
*   **Lack of Transparency**: Pricing is often opaque and requires a sales consultation, creating a barrier for smaller players who need straightforward, accessible tools.

**The Need for a Better Tool:**

There is a clear and unmet need for a solution that democratizes identity verification. We need a tool that offers reliable, AI-driven security without the high costs and complexity of enterprise-grade platforms. This is where **AI-NaMo** comes in—it provides a free, secure, and easy-to-use alternative for anyone who needs to verify identities with confidence.
